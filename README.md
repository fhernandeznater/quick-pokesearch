## Pain Point
### Finding a Pokémon can be challenging and complex
Pokémon is a series of role-playing games that involve catching, training, battling, and trading digital “Pocket Monsters,” or Pokémon for short. The slogan of “Gotta Catch ‘Em All!” has been present since early on; this highlights the game-within-a-game of “completing your Pokédex,” or catching all the Pokémon available within the game.
This game-within-a-game can be difficult to win. Completing the Pokédex typically requires trading with other players, navigating version-exclusive Pokémon, completing uniquely specific in-game actions, and, in one extreme case, learning braille. As the franchise is 30 years old, the amount of Pokémon has ballooned to 1,025. Memorizing information on each one is impossible.
### Searching for Information is Complicated
There are plenty of in-game resources to provide information on where to find a particular Pokémon; however, these in-game resources are intentionally small in scope to provide a challenge to the player. The in-game Pokédex can sometimes provide information as to where to find a particular Pokémon, but not always.
For Pokémon that are particularly difficult to find, it’s essential to use an outside source. In the past, a player typically learned how to find a particular Pokémon through a companion guidebook or a friend. Today, the easiest way to find information about a particular Pokémon is through a web search. However, visiting a website like Bulbapedia or Serebii.net, while both useful websites for this sort of information, can sometimes be overwhelming. There’s so much information associated with each Pokémon that it might be difficult to find exactly what you’re looking for. Players may not necessarily want to see a particular Pokémon’s Abilities, Egg Groups, names in different languages, height and weight, et cetera, when searching.
